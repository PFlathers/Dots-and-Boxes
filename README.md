# Dots-and-Boxes
Simple android game of dots and boxes

## Background
I created this app for Dartmouth's Hackday 4/8/17

## About
This app implements the typical game of dots and boxes. The game implements 
drawing lines between dots in order to create boxes. The person to draw the last
line to make the box earns a point. This game currently only operates locally,
but remote match making and game ai may be added.
